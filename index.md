Hey,

I'm just using this page as a jumping-off point for my various activities on the web...

... namely:

## Domain Oriented Testing (DOT)

I've been working on a [development process that incorporates unit testing](https://www.domainorientedtesting.com/), component testing, BDD-style acceptance testing, and Domain Driven Design (DDD)... in one distilled, highly optimised package that's perfect for diligent software developers. DOT has a real emphasis on rooting out the "unhappy paths" or error conditions that lurk in all business workflows and systems.


## My Software Reality blog on Medium

I post new articles here regularly... mainly about [DOT, programming and testing](https://medium.com/@SoftwareReality/)... with a few other subjects for good measure, like this article about [Android-based e-ink alternatives to Kindle](https://onezero.medium.com/amazon-is-facing-a-quiet-reading-revolution-297b44440616).


## DOT LinkedIn group

Regular discussions about [developer-driven testing](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13804489/), acceptance testing, driving tests from domain models, event storming etc. If you have questions or suggestions about DOT, this is the best place to go.

If you'd like to get in contact, the best way is via [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maffstephens/).

## Articles on The Register

I haven't written anything new there for a good while, but [the articles](https://search.theregister.co.uk/?q=&advanced=1&author=Matt+Stephens) are still there.
